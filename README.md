# Compiler-Design
This repository contains a compiler designed using Yacc, developed during my 3rd year of study. The project implements key phases of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The compiler translates input code into an intermediate representation, showcasing fundamental compiler construction techniques. This project demonstrates how Yacc can be used to parse and process programming languages efficiently.
